# sizechart

It's software that makes size charts.

## Installation

Make sure you have a working `pyglet` and `pygame` (the latter out of
laziness). I'm still terrible at packaging Python, but check your distribution
package manager (or the projects' home pages), and/or use `pip` or
`easy_install`.

Use a Python greater than 3.6. I believe it's tested on Py3.10, if not Py3.11,
as of this writing.

## Running

```
python sizechart.py
```

Or, to load an existing file called `file.svg`:

```
python sizechart.py file.svg
```

## Documentation

TODO for now, please use the source code or ask me. (And maybe open an
issue--it'll remind me to get around to it.)

## License

GPL-3.0, see `COPYING` for details.
